                    <h4>Key Contributions</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>AI Agent Integration:</strong> Architected and implemented an AI-driven conversational agent system 
                            that seamlessly integrated with Unity-based VR applications. This involved designing the overall system

                        <h4>Technical Challenges</h4>
                        <p>
                            One of the main challenges was ensuring real-time performance while maintaining accuracy. Processing video 
                            frames, running pose estimation, and executing ML model inference all needed to happen quickly enough to 
                            provide immediate feedback. This required careful optimization of the pipeline, including frame skipping 
                            strategies, model quantization, and efficient data structures.

                                <strong>Rule-Based Scoring System:</strong> Designed a sophisticated scoring system that evaluates 
                                technique based on biomechanical pose features. The system analyzes factors such as racket angle, 
                                body rotation, weight transfer, and follow-through. The scoring incorporates tolerance for natural 
                                human variation, recognizing that perfect form may vary slightly between players while still identifying 
                                significant technical errors.
